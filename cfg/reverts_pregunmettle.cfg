// INCOMPLETE pre-Gun Mettle Weapon Reverts Config
// Reverts weapons currently available in the plug-in to their pre-Gun Mettle versions as much as possible
// The state that the weapons are reverted to is right before the Gun Mettle Update.
// If there is no pre-Gun Mettle weapon revert available, the weapon revert is turned off unless noted.
// For reverted weapons released after Jungle Inferno, they are left enabled (currently only 1 reverted weapon from Jungle Inferno).
// There are a lot more weapons that aren't reverted to pre-Gun Mettle in this plugin.
// Use this config at your own discretion. If you would like to help contribute to the plugin, please do.
